# Java Exercise

This repo contains both server and client applications for the Phytech Exercise.
To Run the server you should have MySQL running with DB named: phytech,
and set the DB user and password in rest/src/main/resources/application.properties File.
After setting the MySQL server you can enter the rest folder and run the command:
mvn spring-boot:run
To start the server.

After the server is running you can run the client and test the API server functionalities.

Exercise 2 (Checking if string brackets are valid ) runs just before the client app exits.
